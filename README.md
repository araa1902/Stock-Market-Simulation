# stockmarketNEA
This project was built for my A-Level Non-Examined Assessment module related to building a stock market simulator to allow users to paper trade. The program includes historical stock data charts for all stocks within the NYSE exchange, portfolio managment and analysis, and stochastic simulations to model price movements and much more!
